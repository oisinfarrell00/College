Here is the follwoing instructions on how to run my java file (bitCheck.java):
1. download the file.
2. compile the file using "javac bitchech.java"
3. Run the file with the two hashs that you want to compare as command line parameters
    for example: "java bitCheck hash1 hash2"
    This should return the number of similar bits between the two.
