# Lab work 3: Build a Knowledge based system / Expert system
## General
Create rules for and test run the system
Lab 3 is about developing a Knowledge based system / Expert system for a domain. The domain can be anything that supports building rules but you can use the real case below. Here we give an example of two rules for children diseases.

An example: Children diseases

In the children diseases domain, the rules can look like (the rules do not follow the chart presented in the pct and tif file):

Rule 1:	Rubella
Conditions:	Rash beginning on the face which spreads to the rest of the body.
Low fever of less than 38.3 °C (101 °F).
Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy
 

Build at lease 20 rules, where some are using another rule to be able to reach the conclusion. For example:

Rule 2:	Rubella
IF:	Rule 1
Swollen glands
Coryza (cold like symptoms)

Aching joints (especially in young women)
