# Lab work 6: Build and train a neural network
The lab is about building and training a neural network
Training a Neural Network in Tensor-flow
To get an idea about Neural Network for the lab, see the youtube: 
Build a deep neural network in 4 mins with TensorFlow in Colab
## General
For the lab, following is needed, OBS if you do not have the programming language install, do it before the lab:

Python and following Python libraries:

-    Numpy

-   Tensorflow

-  Keras
For Lab instructions, see: ANN and Deep Learning,Tensorflow & KerasLinks to an external site.

Building and training a neural network in Simbrain.
You will not need to program the neurons and write the training algorithms. You use a tool for the network. In order to train the network you will need a data set. You can select an training set from the site referenced in the machine learning task
